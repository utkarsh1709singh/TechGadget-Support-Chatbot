### *TechGadget Support Chatbot*

This is a simple Python-based chatbot designed to provide support for customers visiting the TechGadget website. The chatbot can respond to various user queries related to products, shipping, returns, troubleshooting, and general inquiries.

## Usage
To interact with the chatbot, simply run the script chatbot.py. The chatbot will prompt you to input your queries, and it will respond accordingly. To exit the chat, type "quit", "exit", or "bye".

## Functionalities
Greetings: The chatbot greets users when they initiate a conversation with "hi".
Product Queries: Users can inquire about the availability of smartwatches.
Shipping Information: Users can ask about shipping time and available shipping methods.
Return Policy: The chatbot provides information about the return policy.
Troubleshooting: Users can seek assistance with issues like gadgets not turning on or how to reset devices.

## How It Works
The chatbot utilizes a dictionary-based approach to map user input to predefined responses. When a user input matches a keyword in the dictionary, the chatbot responds with the corresponding message. If no matching keyword is found, the chatbot prompts the user to rephrase the query.
